# scala-contextual
General purpose, lightweight, decorator-based Scala library that enables passing context information across threads as asynchronous computations execute, without requiring method signature changes (e.g. Context Functions in Dotty). Example usage: can be used to support integration of distributed tracing information with Mapped Diagnostic Context in logging.
